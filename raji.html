            <H1>GAUTUM GAMBHIR</H1>
            Born 14 October 1981 is an Indian politician and former
            cricketer, who has played all formats of the game. He is a current member of the Lok Sabha since 2019. He
            received the Padma Shri from the Government of India in 2019, the fourth highest civilian award in India.
            <p>
                As a cricketer, he was a left-handed opening batsman who played domestic cricket for Delhi, and
                captained
                Kolkata Knight Riders and Delhi Daredevils in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He made his One Day
                International (ODI) debut against Bangladesh in 2003, and played his first Test the following year
                against
                Australia. He captained the Indian team in six ODIs from late 2010 to late 2011 with India winning all
                six
                matches. He played an integral part in India's wins in the finals of both the 2007 World Twenty20 (75
                runs
                from 54 balls) and the 2011 Cricket World Cup (97 from 122). Under Gambhir's captaincy, Kolkata Knight
                Riders won their first IPL title in 2012 and went on to win the title again in 2014.
            </p>
            <p>Gambhir was the only Indian and one of four international cricketers to have scored hundreds in five
                consecutive Test matches.[3] He is the only Indian batsman to have scored more than 300 runs in four
                consecutive Test series. As of April 2018, he is the sixth highest run-scorer for India in Twenty20
                Internationals.[4] In October 2018, during the quarter-finals of the 2018–19 Vijay Hazare Trophy, he
                scored his 10,000th run in List A cricket.[5] In December 2018, he announced his retirement from all
                forms of cricket.[6] In 2019, he joined the Bharatiya Janata Party and won election to the Lok Sabha
                from East Delhi.</p>
            <p>He was conferred the Arjuna Award, India's second highest sporting award, in the year 2008 by the
                President of India.[7] In 2009, he was the number one ranked batsman in ICC Test rankings.[8][9] The
                same year, he was the recipient of the ICC Test Player of the Year award. He is currently the mentor of
                Lucknow Super Giants in the IPL.</p>

                International Career</h2>
            <p style="color: rgb(116, 235, 213); font-size: 17px;">While Gambhir was out of the Test team, he played a number of One Day
                Internationals for India between
                2005 and 2007. However, he was not selected for the 2007 World Cup as the selectors opted for a
                top-order of Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, and Sachin Tendulkar. It affected him badly and Gambhir
                later said that "When I got dropped for the World Cup, there were times I didn't want to play anymore. I
                didn't want to practise. I couldn't motivate myself."[24] With no other career options, Gambhir stuck
                with cricket. After India's first-round exit from the tournament, Gambhir was selected for the One Day
                International on India's 2007 tour of Bangladesh. Believing the series could be his last chance,[24]
                Gambhir scored his second century on that tour and was subsequently selected for the One Day
                International on India's tour to Ireland in 2007. He scored an unbeaten 80 against Ireland in the first
                game of that tour and was awarded the man of the match award for that effort. In the post-match
                interview, he indicated that performing more consistently was a top priority for his career as he had
                done so in the past.[25]</p>
            <p style="color: rgb(116, 235, 213); font-size: 17px;">Gambhir was selected in India's squad for the 2007 ICC World Twenty20,
                which India
                went on to win in
                South Africa, beating Pakistan in the final. Gambhir performed well in the shortest form of the game,
                ending the tournament as India's top run scorer, with 227 at an average of 37.83, including three
                half-centuries which included a crucial 75 runs off 54 balls against Pakistan in the final.[26] He was
                named in the 'Team of the Tournament' by Cricinfo for the 2007 T20I World Cup.[27]</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info1">
            <h2 style="color: rgb(252,255,158);">Golden Form</h2>
            <p style="color: rgb(116, 235, 213); font-size: 17px;">
                In 2008, Gambhir was forced to miss the Test series in Australia due to a shoulder injury. In
                the 2007–08 CB Series, he scored an unbeaten 102 at the Gabba against Sri Lanka in a match washed out
                due to
                rain. Three weeks later at Sydney, he scored a career-best 113 off 119 balls against Australia, in a
                high
                scoring match which India lost by 18 runs. He finished the CB series as the leading run-scorer with 440
                runs.

                In 2008 Gambhir finally solidified his place in the Indian Test team with a string of high scores.
                Opening
                the batting with Delhi teammate Virender Sehwag, he scored 858 runs at over 61 in seven matches as of
                December including a double century against Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. However, in the
                same
                match, he was involved in controversy when he elbowed bowler Shane Watson while taking a run. Gambhir
                asserted it was accidental, but was banned for one Test.[29] Gambhir scored 463 runs in the series,
                which
                despite missing the last match was more than any other player in the series.[30]

                He was the leading run-scorer in the Test series against England in December 2008 and against New
                Zealand in
                early 2009, meaning that he had achieved this feat in three consecutive series.

                For his performances in 2008, he was named in the World Test XI and ODI XI by Cricinfo.[31]

                Gambhir played his first major Test series outside the sub-continent, having toured New Zealand in 2009.
                In
                the second Test match, he scored a match-saving 137 in the second innings. He stood more than five
                sessions
                in the middle and faced over 430 balls. This innings led Virender Sehwag, Gambhir's opening partner,
                close
                friend, and captain for the match, to call him 'The Second Wall' in reference to Rahul Dravid. He then
                scored 167 in the second innings of the Third Test to give India an unassailable lead, but rain helped
                the
                New Zealand batsmen to hang on for a draw. Gambhir, with 445 runs in six innings at an average of 89,
                helped
                India win 1–0 to script a series win in that country after 41 years.
